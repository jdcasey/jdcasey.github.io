# John Casey (a.k.a `buildchimp`)

### Professionally

I'm a software engineer trending toward architecture, working on the product build pipeline at Red Hat. I'm interested in all the sexy new things like evolutionary architectures, streaming frameworks, CI/CD (not new, but still), observability, etc. I tend to favor hard engineering topics more than the latest Shiny New Framework. I want to know more about scaling, automating, improving reliability, and reducing support overhead.

### Personally

I'm a hacker with a 3D printer and just enough knowledge of electronics to start a fire without a soldering iron. I'm interested in hacking everything that looks like it could work a little better with a little *tweak*. 

I'm passionate about my coffee.
